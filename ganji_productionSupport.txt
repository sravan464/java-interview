Find Command Examples: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-search-my-linuxunix-server-for-a-file/

find {dir-name} -name {file-name} action
find /dir/ -name "file-to-search" -print

To find out a file called foo.txt in entire server, type:
# find / -name foo.txt

To find out a file named httpd.log :
# find / -type f -name httpd.log

To find out httpd.log file in /home/web-server/ directory, type:
# find /home/web-server/ -type f -name httpd.log

To find out httpd.log file in /home/web-server/ directory without case i.e. match httpd.log, HTTPD.LOG, HTTpd.LOG case, type:
# find /home/web-server/ -type f -iname httpd.log         // case insensitive

'[1-9]\{1,3\}\.[1-9]\{1,3\}\.[1-9]\{1,3\}\.[1-9]\{1,3\}'


want to search all lines in file example.txt which contains word UNIX but same time doesn't contain world Linux.
$ grep UNIX example.txt

exclude all lines which contains Linux we will apply another grep command in this output with option -v to exclude matching word as shown in below grep command :

$ grep UNIX example.txt  | grep -v Linux
UNIX operating system

want to count of a particular word in log file you can use grep -c option to count the word. 
grep -c "Error" logfile.txt


apply this grep command on our example file to find how many lines contains  word e.g. UNIX has occurred in the file : 
$ grep -c UNIX example.txt

want to do case insensitive search than use -i option from grep command in UNIX. Grep -i will find 
occurrence of both Error, error and ERROR and quite useful to display any sort of Error from log file.

grep -i Error logfile


use grep -w command in UNIX if you find whole word instead of just pattern.
grep -w ERROR logfile

grep command line option is "grep -l" which display only the file names which matches the given pattern. 
grep -l ERROR *.log




You can search recursively i.e. read all files under each directory for a string "192.168.1.5"
$ grep -r "192.168.1.5" /etc/

Use grep to search words only
$ grep -w "boo" file


Use grep to search 2 different words
Use the egrep command as follows:
$ egrep -w 'word1|word2' /path/to/file


How do I list just the names of matching files?
Use the -l option to list file name whose contents mention main():
$ grep -l 'main' *.c




Tail a log file
$tail -1000f logfile


To see only lines containing an error / exception in last 5000 lines -
tail -5000 SystemOut.log | grep -i "FileNotFoundException"


To see lines containing any of the multiple errors / exceptions in running logs -
tail -f SystemOut.log | egrep "(WSWS3713E|WSWS3734W|WSVR0605W|javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException|ThreadMonitor)"


To get all error / exception snippets in another file
sed -n '/ERROR/,/EST/p' /opt/WebSphere6/AppServer/profiles/Viva/logs  /VivaWebClusterMemberPsc9800/SystemOut* >> logAna.txt

To find occurences of a particular error in last n days
find /opt/WebSphere6/AppServer/profiles/Viva/logsOld/VivaWebClusterMemberPsc9800/  
-iname "SystemOut*" -mtime -7 -exec zgrep "FileNotFoundException" {} \; >> logAnalysis.txt

#sed 'ADDRESSs/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/FLAGS' filename
#sed 'PATTERNs/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/FLAGS' filename
s is substitute command
/ is a delimiter
REGEXP is regular expression to match
REPLACEMENT is a value to replace


egrep stands for extended grep and it is more powerful than grep command in Unix and allows more regular exception like
 you can use "|" option to search for either Error or Exception by executing just one command.

egrep 'Error|Exception' logfile.txt

egrep 'Error|Exception|Debug' logfile.txt
